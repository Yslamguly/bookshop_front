# Fullstack App - Frontend Part

This Markdown file provides an overview of the frontend part of my fullstack app (online bookshop). The app is developed using React and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to be responsive and includes several essential features, such as pagination, sorting, filtering, and a shopping cart. The app's backend API is hosted in a separate repository, and its link is provided below.

## Features

### 1. Responsive Design
The frontend is built with a responsive layout, ensuring a seamless user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.

### 2. Pagination
To enhance user experience and manage large datasets, the app incorporates pagination. Users can easily navigate through the different pages of content.

### 3. Sorting
Users can sort the displayed books based on specific attributes, enabling them to view the information in ascending or descending order.

### 4. Filtering
The app also allows users to apply filters to the data, helping them narrow down their search and find the information they need quickly.

### 5. Shopping Cart
A shopping cart feature is implemented, enabling users to add books to their cart, review their selections, and proceed to the checkout process.

## Frontend Tech Stack

The frontend part of the fullstack app utilizes the following technologies:

- **React**: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework that aids in designing responsive and customizable interfaces.

## Backend API

The backend API for this project is hosted in a separate repository. You can access the API repository using the following link:

[Link to Backend API Repository](https://github.com/Yslamguly/bookshop_api)

Please refer to the backend repository's documentation for information on the API's endpoints, request/response formats, and how it interacts with the frontend to provide the complete functionality of the fullstack app.

## How to Run the Frontend

To run the frontend part of the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory using the terminal/command prompt.
3. Install the required dependencies by running: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with: `npm start`.
5. Access the app in your web browser by visiting: `http://localhost:3000` (or a different port if specified).

Please note that the app's frontend interacts with the backend API to fetch data and perform various operations. Therefore, ensure that the backend server is also running and accessible while using the app locally.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Š
